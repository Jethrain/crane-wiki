# Water Balls <small><sub><sup>[Return](./)</sup></sub></small>
---
Water balls are zone-5 enemies that will seek towards the player with every beat. They are able to move diagonally.

If a water ball comes into contact with the player, it will  disappear without dropping gold and turn into a pool of water under the player's feet. If it is killed, then a pool of water will form wherever it died.

The water ball is mostly harmless, dealing no damage to the player. It is considered "monkey-like," and so is frozen by the Monkey Paw.
