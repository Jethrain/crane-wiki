Armadillos are an enemy that roll towards the player 1 tile per beat whenever the player crosses its line of sight.  There are 3 types of Armadillos in game; White, Yellow, and Orange.  While the first 2 are a lower and higher damage and health version of one another respectively, Orange Armadillos are more unique by virtue of being able to move diagonally.
