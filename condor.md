# CoNDOR
---
CoNDOR is the main racing organisation for NecroDancer.  Formed in February of 2015, CoNDOR runs a large variety of events for every skill level; from CoNDUIT for rookie racers, PuzzDOR for puzzle makers and solvers, and the open entry Season events culminating in the highest level of play.
### [Rules](condor/rules)
For all races in CoNDOR, we require racers to follow a set of resolution, zoom, and graphical settings.  You can find these settings by clicking above.
### [Seasons](condor/seasons)
Season events run for several weeks, culminating with a playoff bracket.  Most recently we ran Season 6, an ELO ranked table with 2 knockout brackets running alongside.  You can find more details of the Season events by clicking above.
### Weeklies
Our weekly events generally run Sunday to Thursday or Friday, with the playoffs on Friday at 8PM or Saturday at 2PM (both US eastern).  Racers play 2/3 matches with each win awarding a point.  The top 4/8 players after the weekly races are entered into the palyoffs - either a 4-man, double elim bracket, or an 8-man single elim bracket.  Playoff races are best of 3, with a best of 5 finals.
