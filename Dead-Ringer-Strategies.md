## **General**

* ### Lures / Right Spawn

Lures are mostly used for races due to their consistency and safety. However, they are slower than the other strategies listed in this guide.

[![Lures/Right Spawn](http://img.youtube.com/vi/K0Ly6x5amGA/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0Ly6x5amGA)

**Left Side**

1. Start on the left most tile, and lure DR to the bottom of the level.

2. Move to the left of the 4th bell and lure DR to break it.

3. Do the same for the 3rd and 1st bells, moving to the right and under each of the bells respectively.

4. Lure DR into the 2nd bell, and buffer on the tile under the gong until the second phase activates.

5. Move out of DR's path (be careful about enemies blocking your path)

**Right Side**

1. Start on the left most tile, and hit the 3rd bell from the top tile.

2. Move straight up to the 1st bell, and hit it from the top tile. (if the ogre doesn't block DR, you aren't going to the 3rd bell fast enough)

3. Move diagonally to the tile under the gong, and move out of DR's path.
* ### Japanese
Developed by the Japanese community, this strat is faster but less safe than the standard luring as some skeleton spawns can ruin it.

1. Start on the left most tile and head towards the top tile of the 3rd bell. Be sure to move straight up twice to avoid luring DR to the bottom of the stage.

2. Hit the bell at the same time as DR hits the 1st, and move right toward the 4th bell as DR moves downward.

3. Hit the 4th bell from the top, and move up to hit the 2nd bell from the bottom.

4. Move left to lure DR towards the gong.
